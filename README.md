# CSharpDSA
In these codes we will look at the core data structures and algorithms used in most of the applications. We will see the trade-offs involved with choosing each data structure, along with traversal, retrieval, and update algorithms. This is covering linked lists, stacks, queues, binary trees, and hash tables.
